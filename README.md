# Pinball-Machine
With a team of four, designed and developed a Pinball Machine for a Digital Systems class. Our pinball machine was created using photocell sensors, a piezo buzzer, a raspberry pi, a Basys3 board (pushbuttons and seven segment display), as well as a multitude of wires. The base project for the Basys3 was provided by the professor, which only required modifications to one c file (which is included under the Basys 3 Code folder). The main objective of our project was to create an interactive object that showcased the ability of a simple logic function while creating an enjoyable experience for the user.
